[29.24 - 34.24]  I'm a lucky star to be living here today

[98.24 - 102.24]  And Detroit to Houston
[102.24 - 105.24]  And New York to LA

[115.24 - 119.24]  But I'm proud to be an American

[233.24 - 237.24]  Thank you very much
[237.24 - 240.24]  Thank you very very much
[240.24 - 242.24]  Wow
[242.24 - 246.24]  And thank you Dana
[246.24 - 247.58]  comrades respect Mrs Premzya
[247.58 - 251.22]  burdens you referred to as bomb
[251.22 - 253.24]  And thank you Llee
[253.24 - 254.40]  Hurnt from the beginning
[254.40 - 255.24]  Thank you very much
[255.24 - 256.28]  Want to talent?
[256.28 - 258.24]  What a beautiful, beautiful soul
[258.24 - 259.24]  Thank you
[260.22 - 264.26]  Friends, delegates and fellow citizens
[264.26 - 270.24]  I stand before you this evening
[270.24 - 274.00]  With a message of confidence, strings and hope
[274.00 - 282.40]  an incredible victory, and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country.
[286.56 - 293.04]  Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity, and freedom for citizens of every race,
[293.04 - 301.20]  religion, color and creed. The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal
[301.20 - 309.52]  it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise
[309.52 - 319.36]  together or we fall apart. I am running to be President for all of America, not half of America,
[320.00 - 325.28]  because there is no victory in winning for half of America.
[325.28 - 336.80]  So tonight, with faith and devotion, I proudly accept your nomination for President of the United States.
[355.28 - 361.28]  Thank you very much.
[376.00 - 380.32]  Thank you very much, and we will do it right.
[380.96 - 388.80]  I'm going to do it right. Let me begin this evening by expressing my gratitude to the American people
[389.44 - 397.04]  for your outpouring of love and support following the assassination attempt at my rally on Saturday.
[397.68 - 410.24]  As you already know, the assassins bullet came within a quarter of an inch of taking my life.
[411.60 - 416.08]  So many people have asked me what happened. Tell us what happened, please.
[417.12 - 423.60]  And therefore I will tell you exactly what happened, and you'll never hear it from me a second time
[423.60 - 434.16]  because it's actually too painful to tell. It was a warm, beautiful day in the early evening
[434.96 - 439.44]  in Butler Township in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
[443.12 - 451.60]  Music was loudly playing, and the campaign was doing really well. I went to the stage and the crowd
[452.40 - 461.36]  was cheering wildly. Everybody was happy. I began speaking very strongly powerfully and happily
[463.44 - 470.56]  because I was discussing the great job my administration did on immigration at the southern border.
[471.12 - 472.40]  We were very proud of it.
[472.80 - 488.40]  Behind me and to the right was a large screen that was displaying a chart of border crossings under
[488.40 - 499.84]  my leadership. The numbers were absolutely amazing. In order to see the chart, I started to, like this,
[500.00 - 512.64]  turn to my right and was ready to begin a little bit further turn, which I'm very lucky I didn't do.
[513.52 - 523.84]  When I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear,
[523.84 - 535.92]  I said to myself, wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet and moved my right hand to my ear,
[535.92 - 543.52]  brought it down. My hand was covered with blood, just absolutely blood all over the place.
[544.72 - 552.08]  I immediately knew it was very serious that we were under attack and in one movement proceeded to
[552.08 - 563.04]  drop to the ground. Bullets were continuing to fly as very brave, secret service agents rushed
[563.04 - 566.32]  to the stage and they really did, they rushed to this stage.
[566.32 - 584.96]  There was a great people at great risk, I will tell you, and pounced on top of me so that I would be
[584.96 - 592.32]  protected. There was blood pouring everywhere and yet in a certain way I felt very safe because
[593.04 - 605.28]  I had God on my side. I felt that.
[611.12 - 619.04]  The amazing thing is that prior to the shot, if I had not moved my head at that very last instant,
[620.00 - 628.00]  the assassins bullet would have perfectly hit its mark and I would not be here tonight, we would
[628.00 - 635.60]  not be together. The most incredible aspect of what took place on that terrible evening in the
[635.60 - 646.32]  fading sun was actually seen later in almost all cases as you probably know and when even a single
[646.40 - 652.00]  bullet is fired, just a single bullet and we had many bullets that were being fired.
[652.72 - 658.96]  Crouch run for the exits were stamped but not in this case, it's very unusual.
[665.68 - 671.68]  This massive crowd of tens of thousands of people stood by and didn't move an inch.
[672.64 - 678.40]  In fact, many of them bravely but automatically stood up looking for where the sniper would be,
[678.40 - 684.80]  they knew immediately it was a sniper and then began pointing at him. You can see that if you
[684.80 - 689.92]  look at the group behind me, that was just a small group compared to what was in front.
[691.12 - 698.56]  Nobody ran and by not stampeding, many lives were saved but that isn't the reason.
[702.24 - 708.08]  That they didn't move. The reason is that they knew I was in very serious trouble. They saw it,
[708.08 - 717.04]  they saw me go down, they saw the blood and thought actually most did, that I was dead.
[718.00 - 724.00]  They knew it was a shot to the head, they saw the blood and there's an interesting statistic. The
[724.00 - 730.24]  ears are the bloodiest part, something happens with the ears. They bleed more than any other part of
[730.24 - 735.76]  the body for whatever reason. The doctors told me that life said why is there so much blood? He
[735.76 - 745.44]  said it's the ears. They bleed more so we learned something but they just, they just,
[745.44 - 749.20]  this beautiful crowd, they didn't want to leave me. They knew I was in trouble, they didn't want
[749.20 - 754.00]  to leave me and you can see that love written all over their faces.
[754.96 - 763.12]  Incredible people. They're incredible people. Bullets were flying over us,
[764.16 - 770.72]  yet I felt serene but now the secret service agents were putting themselves in peril. They were
[770.72 - 777.68]  in very dangerous territory. Bullets were flying right over and missing them by a very small amount
[777.92 - 789.12]  of inches and then it all stopped. Our secret service sniper from a much greater distance and with
[789.12 - 795.84]  only one bullet used took the assassin's life, took him out.
[795.84 - 804.16]  I'm not supposed to be here tonight.
[826.56 - 837.92]  Thank you. But I'm not and I'll tell you I stand before you in this arena only by the grace
[838.72 - 842.96]  of Almighty God.
[843.12 - 858.08]  In watching the reports over the last few days many people say it was a providential moment.
[859.04 - 865.60]  Probably was. When I rose surrounded by secret service, the crowd was confused because they
[865.60 - 871.04]  thought I was dead and there was great, great sorrow. I could see that on their faces as I looked
[871.04 - 877.36]  at. They didn't know I was looking at. They thought it was over but I could see it. I
[878.56 - 884.24]  wanted to do something to let them know I was okay. I raised my right arm, looked at the
[884.24 - 893.04]  thousands and thousands of people that were breathlessly waiting and started shouting, fight, fight, fight.
[901.60 - 913.12]  Thank you. Once my clenched fist went up and it was high into the air you've all seen that
[914.48 - 923.44]  the crowd realized I was okay and roared with pride for our country like no crowd I have ever heard
[923.44 - 936.64]  before. Never heard anything like. For the rest of my life I will be grateful for the love shown
[936.64 - 944.40]  by that giant audience of patriots that stood bravely on that fateful evening in Pennsylvania.
[944.72 - 951.60]  Tragically the shooter claimed the life of one of our fellow Americans, Corey,
[952.80 - 957.04]  Comparator, unbelievable person, everybody tells me.
[960.00 - 969.36]  Unbelievable. And seriously wounded two other great warriors spoke to them today.
[969.52 - 981.60]  David Dutch and James Copenhaver, who great people. I also spoke to all three families of these
[981.60 - 988.24]  tremendous people. Our love and prayers are with them and always will be we're never going to
[988.24 - 994.24]  forget them. They came for a great rally. They were serious drumsters I want to tell you. They were
[994.24 - 1000.64]  serious drumsters and still are but Corey unfortunately we have to use the past tense he was incredible.
[1001.60 - 1007.20]  He was a highly respected former fire chief respected by everybody was accompanied by his
[1008.32 - 1016.72]  wife Helen, credible woman I spoke to today devastated and two precious daughters. He lost his life
[1016.72 - 1022.16]  selflessly acting as a human shield to protect them from flying bullets he went right over the
[1022.16 - 1026.08]  top of them and was hit. What a fine man he was.
[1052.16 - 1082.08]  I want to thank the fire department and the family for sending his helmet his outfit
[1082.16 - 1088.40]  and it was just something and they're going to do something very special when they get it but we
[1088.40 - 1094.08]  did something which cannot match what happened not even close but I am very proud to say that over
[1094.08 - 1110.00]  the past few days we've raised $6.3 million for the families of David, James and Corey
[1110.80 - 1115.92]  including from a friend of mine just called up he sent me a check right here I just got it
[1116.80 - 1123.04]  $1 million from Dan Nul and thank you Dan.
[1126.96 - 1132.24]  And again when speaking to the family I told them I said well I'm going to be sending you a lot
[1132.24 - 1137.92]  of money but I can't compensate they all said the same thing you're right sir we appreciate so much
[1137.92 - 1144.00]  what you're doing but nothing can take the place in the case of Corey and the other two by the way
[1144.00 - 1148.56]  they were very very seriously injured but now they're doing very well they're going to be okay.
[1150.16 - 1151.44]  They're going to be doing very well.
[1156.88 - 1167.12]  They're warriors so now I ask that we observe a moment of silence in honor of our friend Corey.
[1168.08 - 1191.68]  There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for others. This is the spirit that forged
[1191.68 - 1198.56]  America in her darkest hours and this is the love that will lead America back to the summit of
[1198.56 - 1206.16]  human achievement and greatness this is what we need despite such a heinous attack we unite
[1206.16 - 1212.48]  this evening more determined than ever I am more determined than ever and so are you so is everybody
[1221.84 - 1230.24]  thank you thank you very much
[1241.04 - 1246.88]  our resolve is unbroken and our purpose is unchanged to deliver a government that serves the
[1246.88 - 1254.08]  American people better than ever before nothing will stop me in this mission because our vision
[1254.08 - 1261.52]  is righteous and our cars is pure no matter what obstacle comes our way we will not break we will
[1261.52 - 1269.36]  not bend we will not back down and I will never stop fighting for you your family and our magnificent
[1269.36 - 1271.68]  country never
[1277.20 - 1285.76]  and everything I have to give with all of the energy and fight in my heart and soul I pledge to
[1286.48 - 1290.16]  our nation tonight thank you very much I pledge that to our nation
[1291.52 - 1294.96]  going to turn our nation around and we're going to do it very quickly thank you
[1295.12 - 1309.76]  this election should be about the issues facing our country and how to make America successful safe
[1309.76 - 1311.28]  free and great again
[1317.76 - 1324.16]  in an age when our politics too often divide us now is the time to remember that we are all
[1324.16 - 1331.20]  fellow citizens we are one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all
[1341.28 - 1347.84]  and we must not criminalize dissent or demonize political disagreement which is what's been
[1347.84 - 1354.32]  happening in our country lately at a level that nobody has ever seen before in that spirit the
[1354.32 - 1360.24]  Democrat Party should immediately stop weaponizing the justice system and labeling their political
[1360.24 - 1372.96]  opponent as an enemy of democracy especially since that is not true in fact I am the one
[1372.96 - 1376.00]  saving democracy for the people of our country
[1384.88 - 1391.92]  and very big news as you probably just read when one day a major ruling was handed down from a
[1392.64 - 1400.40]  highly respected federal judge in Florida Eileen Cannon finding that the prosecutor and the fake
[1400.40 - 1409.60]  documents case against me were totally unconstitutional and the entire case was thrown out of court
[1411.12 - 1414.48]  with all of that publicity thrown out of court
[1418.88 - 1425.12]  if Democrats want to unify our country they should drop these partners in witch hunts which I
[1425.12 - 1431.28]  have been going through for approximately eight years and they should do that without delay and
[1431.28 - 1435.92]  allow an election to proceed that is worthy of our people we're going to win it anyway
[1437.28 - 1447.36]  but worthy of our people on this journey I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife
[1447.68 - 1448.88]  Melania
[1448.88 - 1473.04]  And, Melania, thank you very much.
[1473.04 - 1479.96]  You also did something really beautiful, a letter to America calling for national unity,
[1479.96 - 1482.96]  and it really took the Republican Party by surprise.
[1482.96 - 1484.48]  I will tell you, it was beautiful.
[1484.48 - 1500.32]  For some very serious people said that we should take that letter and put it as part of the
[1500.32 - 1501.32]  Republican platform.
[1501.32 - 1504.12]  That would be an honor, wouldn't it?
[1504.12 - 1505.12]  Right?
[1505.12 - 1508.28]  Mr. Congressman?
[1508.28 - 1516.44]  But it captivated so many, so I also want to thank my entire family for being here Don Kimberly,
[1516.44 - 1530.60]  Ivanka and Jared, Eric and Lara, Tiffany and Michael, and Baron, we love our Baron.
[1530.60 - 1546.72]  And of course, my 10 wonderful grandchildren, you saw a few of them up there on my lap before.
[1546.72 - 1547.72]  And how good was Dana?
[1547.72 - 1548.72]  Was Dana good?
[1548.72 - 1550.88]  I mean, was he good?
[1550.88 - 1560.16]  You know, he was on probably the only vacation he's had in about maybe ever, because he works,
[1560.16 - 1563.40]  about 10 years with his wife very far away.
[1563.40 - 1567.28]  I won't tell you where, but very, very far away, beautiful place.
[1567.28 - 1570.52]  And my people called and he said, yeah, I won't be able to do it.
[1570.52 - 1574.32]  This is many, many years, I promised my wife I can't do it.
[1574.32 - 1578.64]  And they came and they said, Dana won't be able to do it, because he was my first second
[1578.64 - 1581.28]  and third choice.
[1581.28 - 1586.32]  I said, well, you know, that's too bad, but I understand he's away and that's good, it's
[1586.32 - 1588.08]  good for him.
[1588.08 - 1593.24]  And that was it, about 30 minutes later, she came back in, sir, Dana just called, he's
[1593.24 - 1595.20]  going to do it.
[1595.20 - 1600.32]  And his wife, she said, you can't turn him down, you just can't do it, you have to go.
[1600.32 - 1604.52]  That's a good wife.
[1604.52 - 1615.00]  So he got on a plane, he got here a little while ago, now he's going to get on the plane
[1615.00 - 1619.32]  and a little while and he's going to go back home to his wife, but they're great.
[1619.32 - 1624.16]  And I just want to thank her and him and their whole family because that's not easy.
[1624.16 - 1625.88]  And Kid Rock, same thing.
[1625.88 - 1626.88]  Call, he said.
[1626.88 - 1631.72]  He said, I want to be a part of it.
[1631.72 - 1636.96]  I want to be a part because you know, kid does his great song, big, big monster song.
[1636.96 - 1642.84]  I had no idea, you know, he became a friend of mine over the last 10 years and he's amazing.
[1642.84 - 1643.84]  Everyone loves him.
[1643.84 - 1644.84]  He didn't even know how big he was.
[1644.84 - 1651.12]  You know, he has rallies, 35, 40,000 people he gets every time he goes out.
[1651.12 - 1654.40]  I think he's making so much money, he doesn't know what the hell to do with it, you want
[1654.40 - 1658.80]  to know.
[1658.80 - 1662.92]  And then we have my other friend and I've known him so long and we took that song and it
[1662.92 - 1665.80]  was a big success, but we made that.
[1665.80 - 1669.00]  I saw a chart of great songs to America.
[1669.00 - 1672.00]  That was number one on the chart recently, number one.
[1673.00 - 1677.00]  Let's see Greenwood, a very special, beautiful person.
[1677.00 - 1679.00]  He's a beautiful man.
[1682.00 - 1685.00]  But they all wanted to be here, they called.
[1685.00 - 1686.00]  And how about the Hulkster?
[1686.00 - 1688.00]  How good was he?
[1688.00 - 1689.00]  He's here.
[1689.00 - 1691.00]  He's here.
[1691.00 - 1693.00]  Boy, oh boy.
[1702.00 - 1706.00]  You know, they may call it, they may call that entertainment.
[1706.00 - 1712.36]  I know about entertainment, but when he used to lift a 350 pound man over his shoulders
[1712.36 - 1718.28]  and then bench press him, two rows into the audience, I said, maybe entertainment, but
[1718.28 - 1720.04]  he is one strong son of a gun.
[1720.04 - 1722.76]  I'm going to tell you, I watched it many times.
[1722.76 - 1726.92]  There are a lot of entertainers that can do that, right?
[1726.92 - 1728.48]  You were fantastic.
[1728.48 - 1730.76]  Thank you very much.
[1731.76 - 1734.76]  What was that all about?
[1734.76 - 1735.76]  Boy, that was good.
[1735.76 - 1737.76]  I didn't want to really come up here.
[1737.76 - 1742.56]  But he was so great and he's such a good young man.
[1742.56 - 1744.56]  He went through a lot of trouble.
[1744.56 - 1746.56]  And Don last night was incredible.
[1746.56 - 1747.96]  They went through so much trouble.
[1747.96 - 1752.00]  They got subpoenaed more than any people probably in the history of the United States.
[1752.00 - 1758.20]  Every week they get another subpoena from the Democrats, crazy Nancy Pelosi, the whole
[1758.20 - 1759.20]  thing.
[1759.20 - 1765.16]  Boom, boom, boom.
[1765.16 - 1768.96]  They've got to stop that because they're destroying our country.
[1768.96 - 1774.40]  We have to work on making America great again, not on beating people.
[1774.40 - 1775.40]  And we won.
[1775.40 - 1776.40]  We beat them in all.
[1776.40 - 1777.40]  We beat them on the impeachments.
[1777.40 - 1778.80]  We beat them on indictments.
[1778.80 - 1779.88]  We beat them.
[1779.88 - 1785.92]  But the time that you have to spend, the time that you have to spend, if they would devote
[1785.92 - 1802.24]  that genius to helping our country, we'd have a much stronger and better country.
[1802.24 - 1806.96]  And Jason, the biggest star in country music, Jason.
[1806.96 - 1810.92]  Thank you for being here.
[1810.92 - 1813.56]  Jason, thank you very much.
[1813.56 - 1815.84]  Jason Alden is good.
[1815.84 - 1820.08]  I like his wife even better by the way she's here.
[1820.08 - 1822.40]  Thank you, Jason.
[1822.40 - 1827.64]  But I'm thrilled to have a new friend and partner fighting by my side.
[1827.64 - 1833.68]  The next Vice President of the United States, the current Senator from Ohio, JD Vance,
[1833.68 - 1835.68]  and his incredible wife, Usha.
[1845.84 - 1855.68]  He's going to be a great Vice President.
[1855.68 - 1856.68]  He's going to be great.
[1856.68 - 1861.48]  He'll be with this country and with this movement, greatest movement in the history of our
[1861.48 - 1862.48]  country.
[1862.48 - 1864.20]  Make America great again.
[1864.20 - 1866.88]  When they criticize it, they say, we're going to try and stop, Mag.
[1866.88 - 1869.36]  I said, Mag is make America great again.
[1869.36 - 1870.36]  What are you going to stop?
[1870.36 - 1871.88]  There's nothing to stop.
[1871.88 - 1873.96]  Then they say, oh, that's right.
[1873.96 - 1877.36]  It's very tough to fight it.
[1877.36 - 1880.80]  And all of the people that did try and fight it have failed.
[1880.80 - 1882.92]  But he's going to be with us for a long time.
[1882.92 - 1885.28]  And it was an honor to select him.
[1885.28 - 1886.96]  Great, great student at Yale.
[1886.96 - 1888.64]  His wife was a great student at Yale.
[1888.64 - 1889.64]  They met at Yale.
[1889.64 - 1894.04]  These are two smart people.
[1894.04 - 1896.88]  So JD, you're going to be doing this for a long time.
[1896.88 - 1897.88]  Enjoy the ride.
[1904.96 - 1912.96]  And a very special thank you to the extraordinary people of Milwaukee and the great state of...
[1912.96 - 1917.32]  Oh, there they are.
[1917.32 - 1919.32]  There they are.
[1919.32 - 1920.32]  That's...
[1920.32 - 1924.36]  You are so easy to spot.
[1924.36 - 1926.56]  And Green Bay is going to have a good team this year, right?
[1926.56 - 1929.56]  They're going to have a good team.
[1929.56 - 1932.20]  They're going to have a good team.
[1932.20 - 1934.20]  Most of the audience doesn't like it, but it's true.
[1934.20 - 1937.48]  You're going to have a very good team this year.
[1937.48 - 1946.24]  And by the way, Wisconsin, we are spending over $250 million here, creating jobs and other
[1946.24 - 1949.64]  economic development all over the place.
[1949.64 - 1954.32]  So I hope you will remember this in November and give us your vote.
[1954.32 - 1956.52]  I am trying to buy your vote.
[1956.52 - 1960.64]  I'll be honest about that.
[1960.64 - 1970.24]  And I promise we will make Wisconsin great again.
[1970.24 - 1974.56]  We're going to make it.
[1974.56 - 1976.08]  Thank you, Mr. Governor.
[1976.08 - 1977.08]  Thank you very much.
[1977.08 - 1978.08]  Thank you.
[1978.08 - 1984.28]  I'm here tonight to lay out a vision for the whole nation to every citizen, whether you're
[1984.28 - 1993.12]  a young or old man or woman, Democrat, Republican or independent, Black or white, Asian or Hispanic.
[1993.12 - 1998.32]  I extend to you a hand of loyalty and of friendship.
[1998.32 - 2003.88]  Together we will lead America to new heights of greatness like the world has never seen before.
[2003.88 - 2006.48]  We were right there in the first term.
[2006.48 - 2007.48]  We got hit with COVID.
[2007.48 - 2008.88]  We did a great job.
[2008.88 - 2012.52]  Nobody knew what it was, but nobody's ever seen an economy pre-COVID.
[2012.52 - 2017.96]  And then we handed over a stock market that was substantially higher than just prior to
[2017.96 - 2019.76]  COVID coming in.
[2019.76 - 2020.76]  Did a great job.
[2020.76 - 2021.84]  Never got credit for that.
[2021.84 - 2028.10]  We got credit for the war and defeating ISIS and so many things, the great economy, the
[2028.10 - 2033.80]  biggest tax cuts ever, the biggest regulation cuts ever, the creation of space force, the
[2033.80 - 2035.28]  rebuilding of our military.
[2035.28 - 2037.48]  We did so much.
[2037.48 - 2038.48]  We did so much.
[2038.48 - 2039.96]  Right to try.
[2039.96 - 2041.72]  Right to try is a big deal.
[2042.44 - 2043.68]  We got right to try.
[2043.68 - 2048.32]  They were trying to get that for 52 years.
[2048.32 - 2053.52]  Somebody is terminally ill and hopefully there's nobody in this audience, but it does happen
[2053.52 - 2054.52]  a lot.
[2054.52 - 2059.16]  They're terminally ill and they can't use our new space age drugs and other things that
[2059.16 - 2063.76]  we are way ahead with the greatest doctors in the world, the greatest laboratories in
[2063.76 - 2065.04]  the world and you can't do it.
[2065.04 - 2067.36]  They've been trying to get that approved for 52 years.
[2067.36 - 2068.64]  Was it that easy?
[2068.64 - 2070.48]  The insurance companies didn't want to do it.
[2070.48 - 2071.48]  They didn't want the risk.
[2071.48 - 2074.84]  The labs didn't want to do it because if it didn't work, people are pretty far down the
[2074.84 - 2076.60]  line toward death.
[2076.60 - 2077.96]  They didn't want to do it.
[2077.96 - 2080.00]  The doctors didn't want to have it on their records.
[2080.00 - 2081.56]  So I got everybody in tour office.
[2081.56 - 2082.80]  52 years they tried.
[2082.80 - 2085.20]  Sound simple, but it's not.
[2085.20 - 2090.44]  And I got them to agree that somebody that needs it will instead of going to Asia, Europe
[2090.44 - 2096.12]  or someplace or if you have no money going home and dying, just die.
[2096.12 - 2097.84]  We got them to sign an agreement.
[2097.84 - 2100.08]  They agreed to it where they're not going to do anybody.
[2100.08 - 2101.40]  They're going to get all of this stuff.
[2101.40 - 2102.96]  They're going to get it really fast.
[2102.96 - 2107.80]  And what's happened is we're saving thousands and thousands of lives.
[2107.80 - 2109.20]  It's incredible.
[2109.20 - 2112.44]  Right to try.
[2112.44 - 2115.52]  It's great feeling.
[2115.52 - 2119.56]  Under our leadership, the United States will be respected again.
[2119.56 - 2121.56]  No nation will question our power.
[2121.56 - 2124.08]  No enemy will doubt our might.
[2124.08 - 2126.32]  Our borders will be totally secure.
[2126.32 - 2129.16]  Our economy will soar.
[2129.16 - 2133.52]  We will return law in order to our streets, patriotism to our schools.
[2133.52 - 2141.00]  And importantly, we will restore peace, stability and harmony all throughout the world.
[2141.00 - 2149.20]  But to achieve this future, we must first rescue our nation from failed and even incompetent
[2149.20 - 2150.36]  leadership.
[2150.36 - 2153.56]  We have totally incompetent leadership.
[2153.56 - 2157.88]  This will be the most important election in the history of our country.
[2157.88 - 2164.32]  Under the current administration, we are indeed a nation in decline.
[2164.32 - 2169.36]  We have an inflation crisis that is making life unaffordable, ravaging the incomes of
[2169.36 - 2175.32]  working and low-income families and crushing, just simply crushing our people.
[2175.32 - 2176.32]  Like never before.
[2176.32 - 2178.68]  They've never seen anything like it.
[2178.72 - 2185.16]  We also have an illegal immigration crisis, and it's taking place right now.
[2185.16 - 2191.52]  As we sit here in this beautiful arena, it's a massive invasion at our southern border
[2191.52 - 2198.16]  that has spread misery, crime, poverty, disease and destruction to communities all across
[2198.16 - 2199.16]  our land.
[2199.16 - 2201.36]  Nobody's ever seen anything like it.
[2201.36 - 2208.24]  Then there is an international crisis, the likes of which the world has seldom been part
[2208.24 - 2209.24]  of.
[2209.24 - 2210.56]  Nobody can believe what's happening.
[2210.56 - 2216.32]  War is now raging in Europe in the Middle East, a growing specter of conflict hangs over
[2216.32 - 2222.52]  Taiwan, Korea, the Philippines and all of Asia, and our planet is teetering on the edge
[2222.52 - 2224.92]  of World War III.
[2224.92 - 2227.92]  And this will be a war like no other war because of weaponry.
[2227.92 - 2233.80]  The weapons are no longer army tanks going back and forth, shooting at each other.
[2233.80 - 2238.16]  These weapons are obliteration.
[2238.16 - 2240.04]  It's time for a change.
[2240.04 - 2244.20]  This administration can't come close to solving the problems.
[2244.20 - 2248.48]  We're dealing with very tough, very fierce people.
[2248.48 - 2251.20]  They're fierce people.
[2251.20 - 2253.24]  And we don't have fierce people.
[2253.24 - 2258.76]  We have people that are a lot less than fierce, except when it comes to cheating on elections
[2258.76 - 2260.24]  and a couple of other things.
[2260.24 - 2262.44]  Then they're fierce.
[2262.44 - 2266.20]  Then they're fierce.
[2266.20 - 2272.76]  So tonight, I make this pledge to the great people of America.
[2272.76 - 2277.72]  I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately, bring down interest rates and
[2277.72 - 2279.72]  lower the cost of energy.
[2279.72 - 2282.72]  We will drill, baby, drill.
[2296.20 - 2309.80]  Can you believe what they're doing?
[2309.80 - 2315.12]  But by doing that, we will lead a large scale decline in prices.
[2315.12 - 2316.92]  Prices will start to come down.
[2316.92 - 2318.32]  Energy raised it.
[2318.32 - 2320.68]  They took our energy policies and destroyed them.
[2320.68 - 2325.64]  Then they immediately went back to them, but by that time, so much was lost.
[2325.64 - 2329.40]  But we will do it at levels that nobody has ever seen before.
[2329.40 - 2331.84]  We'll end lots of different things.
[2331.84 - 2335.04]  We'll start paying off debt and start lowering taxes, even further.
[2335.04 - 2337.44]  We gave you the largest tax cut.
[2337.44 - 2339.40]  We'll do it more.
[2339.40 - 2344.40]  People don't realize our broad taxes weigh down, weigh down.
[2344.40 - 2349.32]  And yet we took in more revenues the following year than we did when the tax rate was much
[2349.32 - 2350.32]  higher.
[2350.32 - 2351.56]  Most people said, how did you do that?
[2351.56 - 2354.20]  Because it was incentive.
[2354.20 - 2355.68]  Everybody was coming to the country.
[2355.68 - 2360.04]  They were bringing back billions and billions of dollars into our country.
[2360.04 - 2362.68]  The companies made it impossible to bring it back.
[2362.68 - 2364.80]  The tax rate was too high.
[2364.80 - 2368.24]  And the legal complications were far too great.
[2368.24 - 2370.92]  I changed both of them.
[2370.92 - 2375.56]  And hundreds of billions of dollars by Apple and so many other companies would brought
[2375.56 - 2377.12]  back into our nation.
[2377.12 - 2382.64]  We had an economy, the likes of which nobody, no nation had ever seen China.
[2382.64 - 2388.44]  We were beating them at levels that were incredible.
[2388.44 - 2389.84]  And they know it.
[2389.84 - 2390.84]  They know it.
[2390.84 - 2393.80]  We'll do it again, but we'll do it even better.
[2393.80 - 2400.12]  I will end the illegal immigration crisis by closing our border and finishing the wall,
[2400.12 - 2402.12]  most of which I've already built.
[2402.12 - 2414.04]  On the wall, we were dealing with a very difficult Congress.
[2414.04 - 2415.72]  And I said, oh, that's okay.
[2415.72 - 2417.00]  We won't go to Congress.
[2417.00 - 2419.04]  I call it an invasion.
[2419.04 - 2422.44]  We gave our military almost $800 billion.
[2422.44 - 2426.56]  I said, I'm going to take a little of that money because this is an invasion.
[2426.56 - 2429.24]  We built most of the wall, it's already built.
[2429.24 - 2434.00]  And we built it through using the funds because what's better than that?
[2434.00 - 2441.76]  We have to stop the invasion into our country that's killing hundreds of thousands of people
[2441.76 - 2442.76]  a year.
[2442.76 - 2448.24]  We're not going to let that happen.
[2448.24 - 2455.20]  I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created,
[2455.20 - 2460.20]  including the horrible war with Russia and Ukraine, which would have never happened
[2460.20 - 2462.12]  if I was president.
[2462.12 - 2469.08]  And the war caused by the attack on Israel, which would have never happened if I was president.
[2469.08 - 2470.08]  Iran was broke.
[2470.08 - 2471.48]  Iran had no money.
[2471.48 - 2474.28]  Now Iran has $250 billion.
[2474.28 - 2477.64]  They made it all over the last two and a half years.
[2477.64 - 2478.96]  They were broke.
[2478.96 - 2482.28]  I watched the other day on a show called DeFaced the Nation.
[2482.28 - 2484.60]  Has anyone seen it?
[2484.60 - 2489.08]  They had a congressman who was a Democrat, say, well, whether you like them or not, Iran
[2489.08 - 2490.68]  was broke, dealing with Trump.
[2490.68 - 2496.76]  I told China and other countries, if you buy from Iran, we will not let you do any business
[2496.76 - 2497.76]  in this country.
[2497.76 - 2505.48]  And we will put tariffs on every product you do send in of 100 percent a month.
[2505.48 - 2507.72]  And they said to me, well, I think that's about it.
[2507.72 - 2509.88]  They weren't going to buy any oil.
[2509.88 - 2511.36]  And they were ready to make a deal.
[2511.36 - 2513.00]  Iran was going to make a deal with us.
[2513.00 - 2518.16]  And then we had that horrible, horrible result that will never let happen again.
[2518.16 - 2521.16]  The election result will never let that happen again.
[2521.16 - 2522.56]  They used COVID to cheat.
[2522.56 - 2526.08]  You're never going to let it happen again.
[2526.08 - 2531.52]  And they took off all the sanctions and they did everything possible for Iran.
[2531.52 - 2536.28]  And now Iran is very close to having a nuclear weapon, which would have never happened.
[2536.28 - 2537.96]  This is a shame.
[2537.96 - 2541.52]  What this administration did damage at this administration has done.
[2541.52 - 2546.64]  And I say it often, if you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States,
[2546.64 - 2547.64]  think of it.
[2547.64 - 2549.24]  The 10 worst added them up.
[2549.24 - 2555.60]  They will not have done the damage that Biden has done, only going to use the term once.
[2555.60 - 2559.52]  Biden, I'm not going to use the name anymore, just one time.
[2559.52 - 2562.68]  The damage that he's done to this country is unthinkable.
[2562.68 - 2565.04]  It's unthinkable.
[2565.04 - 2571.74]  Together we will restore vision, strength, competence, and we're going to have a thing called
[2571.74 - 2574.64]  common sense making most of our decisions, actually.
[2574.64 - 2580.04]  It's all common sense.
[2580.04 - 2586.76]  Just a few short years ago, under my presidency, we had the most secure border in best economy.
[2586.76 - 2591.28]  In the history of our country, in the history of the world, we had the greatest economy.
[2591.28 - 2595.72]  In the history of the world, we had never done anything like it.
[2595.72 - 2599.64]  We were beating every country, including China by leaps and bounds.
[2599.64 - 2601.68]  Nobody had seen anything like it.
[2601.68 - 2606.00]  We had no inflation, soaring incomes were going.
[2606.00 - 2608.24]  Nobody's, nobody can believe it.
[2608.24 - 2615.08]  You can't believe what happened four years ago is happening now in reverse.
[2615.08 - 2617.56]  And the world was at peace.
[2617.56 - 2619.16]  Inflation has been a killer for our country.
[2619.16 - 2623.12]  No matter what you make it, it doesn't matter because inflation is eating you alive, people
[2623.12 - 2628.56]  that were putting away money, they were making great wages, the highest they've ever made,
[2628.56 - 2630.08]  but they were putting away a lot of money.
[2630.08 - 2632.72]  Now they are just being destroyed.
[2632.72 - 2634.20]  They're not putting away anything.
[2634.20 - 2635.20]  They're barely living.
[2635.20 - 2640.04]  They're going into savings accounts that take in out their money to live because of inflation.
[2640.04 - 2643.00]  Inflation, remember, it's called a country, Buster.
[2643.00 - 2646.84]  You can go back to Germany from a hundred years ago.
[2646.84 - 2650.68]  You can go back to any country that suffered great inflation.
[2650.68 - 2653.64]  We've suffered the worst inflation we've ever had.
[2653.64 - 2656.24]  But go back and see what's happened to those countries.
[2656.24 - 2661.36]  We've had the worst inflation we've ever had under this person.
[2661.36 - 2668.04]  But in less than four years, our opponents have turned incredible success into unparalleled
[2668.04 - 2669.28]  tragedy and failure.
[2669.28 - 2672.08]  It's been a tremendous failure.
[2672.08 - 2675.60]  Today our cities are flooded with illegal aliens.
[2675.60 - 2680.16]  Those are being squeezed out of the labor force and their jobs are taken.
[2680.16 - 2684.16]  By the way, you know who's taking the jobs, the jobs that are created.
[2684.16 - 2689.44]  107 percent of those jobs are taken by illegal aliens.
[2689.44 - 2695.14]  And you know who's being hurt the most by millions of people pouring into our country, the
[2695.14 - 2702.18]  black population and the Hispanic population because they're taking the jobs from our black
[2702.18 - 2706.10]  population, our Hispanic population.
[2706.10 - 2709.22]  And they're also taking them from unions.
[2709.22 - 2712.18]  The unions are suffering because of it.
[2712.18 - 2713.58]  Thank you.
[2713.58 - 2714.58]  Thank you.
[2714.58 - 2717.22]  I like you too.
[2717.22 - 2719.82]  Thank you very much.
[2719.82 - 2724.06]  Inflation is wiped out the life savings of our citizens and forced the middle class into
[2724.06 - 2727.02]  a state of depression and despair.
[2727.02 - 2728.02]  That's what it is.
[2728.02 - 2730.02]  It's despair and depression.
[2730.02 - 2732.82]  We cannot and will not let this continue.
[2732.82 - 2739.94]  Less than four years ago, we were a great nation and we will soon be a great nation again.
[2739.94 - 2745.14]  We're going to be a great nation again.
[2745.14 - 2751.38]  Thank you.
[2751.38 - 2756.42]  With proper leadership, every disaster we are now enduring will be fixed and it will
[2756.42 - 2758.78]  be fixed very, very quickly.
[2758.78 - 2764.14]  So tonight, whether you've supported me in the past or not, I hope you will support
[2764.14 - 2768.86]  me in the future because I will bring back the American dream.
[2768.86 - 2770.02]  That's what we're going to do.
[2770.02 - 2775.38]  You don't even hear about the American dream anymore.
[2775.38 - 2781.82]  With great humility, I am asking you to be excited about the future of our country.
[2781.82 - 2782.82]  Be excited.
[2782.82 - 2800.22]  And by the way, the news reports, oh, look at all of those big networks.
[2800.22 - 2801.22]  Look at them.
[2801.22 - 2802.62]  They're all here.
[2802.62 - 2811.66]  But every one of them, as said, this could be the most organized, best run and most enthusiastic
[2811.66 - 2821.46]  convention of either party that they have ever seen, every single one.
[2821.46 - 2822.46]  And it's true.
[2822.46 - 2823.46]  It's true.
[2823.46 - 2825.66]  And there's love in the room.
[2825.66 - 2833.70]  There's great love in the room.
[2833.70 - 2836.02]  So I better finish strong.
[2836.02 - 2840.10]  Otherwise we'll blow it and we can't let that happen.
[2840.10 - 2841.10]  Now this was great.
[2841.10 - 2844.22]  All of the great people that spoke and everybody hit a home run.
[2844.22 - 2848.70]  I mean, there's not one that I can think of where I said, oh, gee, that wasn't great.
[2848.70 - 2850.90]  Every single person.
[2850.90 - 2852.50]  I refuse to be the only one.
[2852.50 - 2854.30]  Don't do that to me.
[2854.30 - 2855.30]  They're already getting ready.
[2855.30 - 2858.50]  See, I gave them an idea.
[2858.50 - 2860.42]  Now we had a, this was a great convention.
[2860.42 - 2863.18]  This was, I think we're actually going to go home and miss it.
[2863.18 - 2866.18]  You know, usually with a, first of all, look at these crowds.
[2866.18 - 2867.70]  You never have this at a convention.
[2867.70 - 2868.70]  Look at these crowds.
[2868.70 - 2879.42]  Love, it's about love.
[2879.42 - 2885.74]  This week the entire Republican Party has formally adopted an agenda for America's renewal
[2885.74 - 2887.62]  and you saw that agenda.
[2887.62 - 2896.06]  And it's very short compared to the long, boring, meaningless agendas of the past, including
[2896.06 - 2897.06]  the Democrats.
[2897.06 - 2901.06]  They write these things at hundreds of pages long and they never read them after they're
[2901.06 - 2902.62]  done.
[2902.62 - 2907.58]  In their case, fortunately, they don't read them because they're pretty bad.
[2907.58 - 2913.06]  It's a series of bold promises that we will swiftly implement when you give us a Republican
[2913.06 - 2914.86]  House.
[2914.86 - 2919.14]  And Mr. Speaker, thank you very much.
[2919.14 - 2922.58]  We have our great speaker of the House with us tonight.
[2922.58 - 2925.02]  Mr. Speaker, thank you very much.
[2925.02 - 2929.34]  Thank you.
[2929.34 - 2933.78]  A Republican Senate, we have many senators here.
[2933.78 - 2938.86]  And send me back to our beautiful White House just a few short months from now.
[2938.86 - 2941.58]  We're talking about just months.
[2941.58 - 2944.34]  It can't come fast enough.
[2944.34 - 2946.70]  We have to get it done.
[2946.70 - 2951.54]  First we must get economic relief to our citizens starting on day one.
[2951.54 - 2955.30]  We will drive down prices and make America affordable again.
[2955.30 - 2956.50]  We have to make it affordable.
[2956.50 - 2958.54]  It's not affordable.
[2958.54 - 2960.86]  People can't live like this.
[2960.86 - 2966.94]  Under this administration, our current administration, groceries are up.
[2966.94 - 2970.74]  57 percent gasoline is up 60 and 70 percent.
[2970.74 - 2973.90]  Mortgage rates have quite droopled.
[2973.90 - 2977.62]  And the fact is, it doesn't matter what they are because you can't get the money anywhere.
[2977.62 - 2978.62]  You can't buy houses.
[2978.62 - 2981.18]  Young people can't get any financing to buy a house.
[2981.18 - 2989.70]  The total household costs have increased an average of $28,000 per family under this administration.
[2989.70 - 2995.46]  Republicans have a plan to bring down prices and bring them down very, very rapidly.
[2995.46 - 3002.02]  By slashing energy costs, we will, in turn, reduce the cost of transportation, manufacturing,
[3002.02 - 3004.18]  and all household goods.
[3004.18 - 3007.54]  So much starts with energy.
[3007.54 - 3011.98]  And remember, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country by far.
[3011.98 - 3020.90]  We are a nation that has the opportunity to make an absolute fortune with its energy.
[3020.90 - 3023.66]  We have it and China does it.
[3023.66 - 3030.70]  Under the Trump administration, just three and a half years ago, we were energy independent.
[3030.70 - 3033.58]  But soon we will actually be better than that.
[3033.58 - 3040.34]  We will be energy dominant and supply not only ourselves, but we will supply the rest
[3040.34 - 3046.06]  of the world with numbers that nobody has ever seen.
[3046.06 - 3050.10]  And we will reduce our debt $36 trillion.
[3050.10 - 3051.66]  We will start reducing that.
[3051.66 - 3055.66]  And we will also reduce your taxes still further.
[3055.66 - 3056.66]  Next.
[3056.66 - 3060.42]  And by the way, they want to raise your taxes four times.
[3060.42 - 3061.42]  Think of it.
[3061.42 - 3065.62]  When all my life I grew up watching politicians, I always loved politics, I guess I was on the
[3065.62 - 3070.18]  other side, and they were always talking about, we will give you a tax cut.
[3070.18 - 3071.94]  We will give you a tax cut.
[3071.94 - 3076.14]  My whole life I was watching, I will give you a tax cut, right, Mr. Congressman?
[3076.14 - 3077.78]  That's all they talked about.
[3077.78 - 3081.98]  This is the only administration that said, we're going to raise your taxes by four times
[3081.98 - 3082.98]  what you're paying now.
[3082.98 - 3084.62]  And people are supposed to vote for them.
[3084.62 - 3086.74]  I've never heard it.
[3086.74 - 3088.22]  You're paying too much.
[3088.22 - 3091.70]  We're going to reduce your taxes still further.
[3091.70 - 3093.70]  We gave you the biggest one, as I said.
[3093.70 - 3097.78]  We're going to give you more, and it's going to lead to tremendous growth.
[3097.78 - 3099.62]  We want growth in our country.
[3099.62 - 3106.26]  That's what's going to pay off our debt.
[3106.26 - 3111.66]  And next we will end the ridiculous and actually incredible waste of taxpayer dollars that is
[3111.66 - 3113.62]  fueling the inflation crisis.
[3113.62 - 3118.90]  They spent trillions of dollars on things having to do with the green new scam.
[3118.90 - 3120.54]  It's a scam.
[3120.54 - 3126.82]  And that's caused tremendous inflationary pressures in addition to the cost of energy.
[3126.82 - 3132.42]  And all of the trillions of dollars that are sitting there not yet spent, we will redirect
[3132.42 - 3137.42]  that money for important projects like roads, bridges, dams, and we will not allow it to
[3137.42 - 3142.82]  be spent on meaningless green new scam ideas.
[3142.82 - 3160.82]  And I will end the electric vehicle mandate on day one.
[3160.82 - 3166.26]  Thereby saving the U.S. auto industry from complete obliteration, which is happening right
[3166.26 - 3175.94]  now and saving U.S. customers thousands and thousands of dollars per car.
[3175.94 - 3182.50]  And right now as we speak, large factories just started are being built across the border
[3182.50 - 3183.50]  in Mexico.
[3183.50 - 3188.06]  So with all the other things happening in our border, and they're being built by China
[3188.06 - 3193.90]  to make cars and to sell them into our country, no tax, no anything, the United Auto
[3193.98 - 3198.30]  Workers ought to be ashamed for allowing this to happen.
[3198.30 - 3203.10]  And the leader of the United Auto Workers should be fired immediately and every single
[3203.10 - 3209.10]  auto worker, union and non-union should be voting for Donald Trump because we're going
[3209.10 - 3218.82]  to bring back car manufacturing and we're going to bring it back fast.
[3218.82 - 3222.66]  They're building some of the largest auto plants anywhere in the world.
[3222.66 - 3229.38]  We're going to make them, we don't mind that happening, but those plants are going to
[3229.38 - 3239.50]  be built in the United States and our people are going to man those plants.
[3239.50 - 3244.70]  And if they don't agree with us, we'll put a tariff of approximately 100 to 200 percent
[3244.70 - 3246.22]  on each car.
[3246.22 - 3251.58]  And they will be unsalable in the United States.
[3251.58 - 3256.30]  We have long been taken advantage of by other countries.
[3256.30 - 3260.94]  And think of it, oftentimes these other countries are considered so-called allies.
[3260.94 - 3262.82]  They've taken advantage of us for years.
[3262.82 - 3267.94]  We lose jobs, we lose revenue, and they gain everything and wipe out our businesses,
[3267.94 - 3269.30]  wipe out our people.
[3269.30 - 3275.02]  I stopped it for four years, I stopped it, and we're really ready to make changes like
[3275.02 - 3276.54]  nobody had seen before.
[3276.54 - 3282.18]  And remember, a U.S. MCA, I got rid of NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made, and replaced
[3282.18 - 3287.50]  it with U.S. MCA, which is they say the best trade deal ever made.
[3287.50 - 3292.06]  Actually, probably the best trade deal was the deal I made with China, where they buy
[3292.06 - 3294.50]  $50 billion worth of our product.
[3294.50 - 3295.90]  They were buying nothing.
[3295.90 - 3299.50]  They buy $50 billion worth they had to.
[3299.50 - 3301.50]  But I don't even talk about it because of COVID.
[3301.54 - 3306.30]  I don't even mention it, frankly, because of what happened with the China virus.
[3306.30 - 3320.42]  We will not let countries come in, take our jobs, and plunder our nation.
[3320.42 - 3323.82]  They come into the, they plunder our nation.
[3323.82 - 3329.94]  The way they will sell their product in America is to build it in America.
[3329.94 - 3350.58]  They're very simple, build it in America, and only in America.
[3350.58 - 3355.94]  And this very simple formula in Congress has to go along with us, and they will.
[3355.94 - 3359.74]  This very simple formula will create massive numbers of jobs.
[3359.74 - 3365.74]  We will take over the auto industry again, and many, many hundreds of thousands of jobs.
[3365.74 - 3367.94]  We lost so many jobs over the years.
[3367.94 - 3374.26]  If you go back 20, 25 years, they've stolen going to China and Mexico, about 68 percent
[3374.26 - 3376.90]  of our auto industry manufacturing jobs.
[3376.90 - 3378.02]  We're going to get them all back.
[3378.02 - 3383.06]  We're going to get them all back every one of them.
[3383.06 - 3390.66]  At the center of our plan for economic relief, our massive tax cuts for workers that include
[3390.66 - 3394.66]  something else that's stirred out to be very popular, actually.
[3394.66 - 3399.22]  Here it's very popular in this building, and all those hotels that I saw that are so nice
[3399.22 - 3401.34]  I'm staying in a nice one.
[3401.34 - 3404.26]  It's called No Tax On Tips.
[3404.26 - 3422.54]  No Tax On Tips.
[3422.54 - 3429.94]  I got that by having dinner recently in Nevada where we're leading by about 14 points.
[3429.94 - 3430.94]  Hello.
[3431.94 - 3435.54]  I'll see you there very soon, everybody.
[3435.54 - 3440.94]  We're having dinner at a beautiful restaurant in the Trump building on the strip, and it's
[3440.94 - 3443.34]  a great building, and the waitress comes over.
[3443.34 - 3444.34]  How's everything going?
[3444.34 - 3445.74]  Really nice person.
[3445.74 - 3448.30]  How's everything all so, so tough?
[3448.30 - 3452.06]  The government's after me all the time on tips, tips, tips.
[3452.06 - 3454.46]  I said, well, they give you cash, would they be able to find them?
[3454.46 - 3455.90]  She said, actually, and I didn't know that.
[3455.90 - 3457.46]  She said, very little cash is given.
[3457.46 - 3461.66]  So I'll put right on the check, and they come in and they take so much of our money.
[3461.66 - 3465.78]  It's just ridiculous, and they don't believe anything we say, and they've just tired,
[3465.78 - 3474.98]  as you know, 88,000 agents to go after them even more.
[3474.98 - 3480.18]  And I said, this shows the level of most people who are at the higher consultants, they pay
[3480.18 - 3482.14]  millions of dollars.
[3482.14 - 3484.94]  But I said to her, let me just ask you a question.
[3484.94 - 3486.86]  You'd be happy if you had no tax on tips.
[3486.86 - 3488.66]  She said, what a great idea.
[3488.66 - 3491.30]  I got my information from a very smart waitress.
[3491.30 - 3495.94]  That's better than spending millions of dollars.
[3495.94 - 3500.34]  And everybody loves it.
[3500.34 - 3507.70]  Waitresses and caddies and drivers and everybody's a large group of people that are being
[3507.70 - 3508.70]  really hurt badly.
[3508.70 - 3512.14]  They make money, let them keep their money.
[3512.14 - 3515.70]  I'm going to protect Social Security and Medicare.
[3515.70 - 3521.06]  Democrats are going to destroy Social Security and Medicare because all of these people by
[3521.06 - 3525.90]  the millions that are coming in, they're going to be on Social Security and Medicare and
[3525.90 - 3529.42]  other things, and you're not able to afford it.
[3529.42 - 3533.66]  They are destroying your Social Security and your Medicare.
[3533.66 - 3539.34]  Under my plan, incomes will skyrocket, inflation will vanish, completely jobs will come roaring
[3539.34 - 3545.10]  back, and the middle class will prosper like never, ever before, and we're going to do
[3545.10 - 3553.34]  it very rapidly.
[3553.34 - 3560.58]  But no hope or dream we have for America can succeed unless we stop the illegal immigrant
[3560.58 - 3564.10]  invasion, the worst that's ever been seen anywhere in the world.
[3564.10 - 3566.42]  There's never been an invasion like this anywhere.
[3566.42 - 3571.90]  Third world countries would fight with sticks and stones not to let this happen.
[3571.90 - 3575.94]  The invasion at our southern border, we will stop it and we will stop it quickly.
[3575.94 - 3583.86]  You heard Tom Homan yesterday, Tom Homan, put him in charge and just sit back and watch.
[3583.86 - 3588.02]  Brandon Judd, the Border Patrol is incredible.
[3588.02 - 3592.38]  These guys, you know, really their job is a lot easier if they don't have to do anything,
[3592.38 - 3593.38]  but they want to.
[3593.38 - 3594.38]  They're patriots.
[3594.38 - 3597.22]  Brandon Judd, Border Patrol, ice goes out.
[3597.22 - 3601.50]  You have to see what ice does with MS-13.
[3601.50 - 3604.34]  These are probably the worst gang and ice goes in there.
[3604.34 - 3608.42]  And I know a lot of people in these rows here and they're very tough people, but they don't
[3608.42 - 3610.30]  want to do this job.
[3610.30 - 3613.18]  They'll go into a pack of MS-13 killers.
[3613.18 - 3616.34]  They're the worst, probably the worst gangs in the world.
[3616.34 - 3617.42]  We have thousands of them.
[3617.42 - 3621.50]  I moved thousands and thousands out in my four years.
[3621.50 - 3623.18]  We moved them out and it was a pleasure.
[3623.18 - 3627.06]  But ice would go right into a pack of these killers and you see fist flying, you see
[3627.06 - 3629.90]  everything flying and then they take them.
[3629.90 - 3632.66]  They put them in a patty wagon.
[3632.66 - 3635.26]  They take them back and they get them out of our country.
[3635.26 - 3638.70]  And the other countries weren't accepting them back and I called up and I said, tell them
[3638.70 - 3641.82]  that we're not giving them economic aid anymore.
[3641.82 - 3646.74]  And the next day I got calls from all of these countries that were terminated.
[3646.74 - 3652.38]  Things of dollars we spend on economic aid to countries that does us frankly no good.
[3652.38 - 3655.46]  And the next day I was called by everybody, couldn't take all the calls.
[3655.46 - 3656.96]  Sir, what's the problem?
[3656.96 - 3662.94]  I said, you won't take your killers back that you sent in caravans into America.
[3662.94 - 3663.94]  You won't take them back.
[3663.94 - 3669.86]  Well, sir, if you'd like us to, we would give very serious consideration to doing that.
[3669.86 - 3674.78]  And within 24 hours, they were being taken back for years and years.
[3674.78 - 3680.66]  And when I first came in, they said President Obama tried to get them to go back and they
[3680.66 - 3681.66]  wouldn't accept them.
[3681.66 - 3684.22]  They put planes on the runway so you couldn't lead the plane.
[3684.22 - 3686.26]  They closed the road so you couldn't take the buses.
[3686.26 - 3688.30]  It all have to turn back.
[3688.30 - 3692.94]  As soon as I said no more economic aid of any kind to any country that does that, they
[3692.94 - 3697.30]  call back and they said, sir, it would be a great honor to take MS-13.
[3697.30 - 3702.90]  We love them very much.
[3702.90 - 3704.38]  We love them very much, sir.
[3704.38 - 3706.70]  We'll take them back.
[3706.70 - 3711.58]  At the heart of the Republican platform is our pledge to end this border nightmare and
[3711.58 - 3716.18]  fully restore the sacred and sovereign borders of the United States of America.
[3716.18 - 3724.30]  We're going to do that on day one.
[3724.30 - 3727.30]  That means two things on day one, right?
[3727.30 - 3738.30]  Little baby drill and close our borders.
[3738.30 - 3743.54]  And by the way, and I think everybody as a Republican, as a patriot in this room and most
[3743.54 - 3750.22]  Democrats, we want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country
[3750.22 - 3752.22]  legally.
[3752.30 - 3764.62]  Less than four years ago, I handed this administration the strongest border in American history, but
[3764.62 - 3767.74]  you can see on the chart that saved my life.
[3767.74 - 3769.34]  That was the chart that saved my life.
[3769.34 - 3770.34]  I said, look it.
[3770.34 - 3771.34]  I'm so proud of it.
[3771.34 - 3775.78]  I think it's one of the greatest, it was done by the Border Patrol, one of the greatest
[3775.78 - 3776.78]  charts I've ever seen.
[3776.78 - 3778.82]  It showed everything just like that.
[3778.82 - 3779.82]  You know the chart.
[3779.82 - 3780.82]  Oh, there it is.
[3780.82 - 3781.82]  That's pretty good.
[3781.82 - 3791.34]  Last time I put up that chart, I never really got to look at it.
[3791.34 - 3800.78]  But without that chart, I would not be here today.
[3800.78 - 3810.26]  Never got to look at it.
[3810.26 - 3815.22]  I said, you got to see this chart.
[3815.22 - 3816.58]  I was so proud of it.
[3816.58 - 3821.98]  And by the time I got to there, I never got to see it that day.
[3821.98 - 3824.02]  But I'm seeing it now and I was very proud.
[3824.02 - 3828.66]  If you look at the arrow in the bottom, that's the lowest level, the one on the bottom,
[3828.66 - 3829.66]  heavy red arrow.
[3829.66 - 3834.94]  That's the lowest level of illegal immigrants ever to come into our country and record
[3834.94 - 3840.06]  it history right there.
[3840.06 - 3842.94]  And that was my last week in office.
[3842.94 - 3844.78]  And then you see what happened after I left.
[3844.78 - 3845.78]  Look at the rest.
[3845.78 - 3849.82]  And if you go out a little bit further, it's getting to be a little bit old.
[3849.82 - 3852.14]  But I love it anyway, right?
[3852.14 - 3854.18]  But you can go much higher with those numbers.
[3854.18 - 3856.38]  Look what happened right after that.
[3856.38 - 3857.70]  The invasion began.
[3857.70 - 3858.70]  We had the opposite.
[3858.70 - 3860.26]  We stopped the invasion.
[3860.26 - 3866.10]  But the invasion that we stopped was peanuts by comparison to what happened after I left.
[3866.10 - 3867.90]  Look at what happened after I left.
[3867.90 - 3870.22]  They took over our country.
[3870.22 - 3872.82]  We ended all catch and release.
[3872.82 - 3874.86]  We shut down asylum fraud.
[3874.86 - 3880.94]  We stopped human trafficking and forged historic agreements to keep illegal aliens on foreign
[3880.94 - 3881.94]  soil.
[3881.94 - 3883.62]  We want them to stay on this soil.
[3883.62 - 3888.30]  Under the Trump administration, if you came in illegally, you were apprehended immediately
[3888.30 - 3890.34]  and you were deported.
[3890.34 - 3892.58]  You went right back.
[3892.58 - 3898.30]  The current administration terminated every single one of those great Trump policies that
[3898.30 - 3900.86]  I put in place to seal the border.
[3900.86 - 3904.22]  I wanted to seal border again, come in, but come in legally.
[3904.22 - 3905.74]  You know how unfair it is?
[3905.74 - 3910.62]  So many people, hundreds of thousands of people have been working for years to come into
[3910.62 - 3912.26]  our country.
[3912.26 - 3916.14]  And now they see these people pour into our country at levels that are unprecedented.
[3916.14 - 3917.14]  It's so unfair.
[3917.14 - 3918.70]  Now, we're not going to do it.
[3918.70 - 3919.90]  We're not going to stand for it.
[3919.90 - 3923.90]  We suspended wall construction and did remain in Mexico.
[3923.90 - 3925.78]  We had a policy, remain in Mexico.
[3925.78 - 3929.50]  You think that was easy to get from the Mexican government, but I said you must give it to
[3929.50 - 3930.50]  us.
[3930.50 - 3934.14]  If you don't give it to us, there will be repercussions and they gave it to us, but
[3934.14 - 3935.14]  not easy.
[3935.14 - 3938.50]  Canceled our safe third agreements.
[3938.50 - 3942.90]  Demolish Title 42 implemented nationwide catch and release.
[3942.90 - 3947.30]  That's catch and release where we catch them and release them into our country.
[3947.30 - 3950.70]  I had we catch them and release them into Mexico.
[3950.70 - 3953.58]  It was a slight difference.
[3953.58 - 3955.10]  And took 93.
[3955.10 - 3959.30]  This is the previous administration.
[3959.30 - 3963.30]  93 executive actions to throw open our border to the world.
[3963.30 - 3969.30]  The entire world is pouring into our country because of this very foolish administration.
[3969.30 - 3973.50]  The greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country.
[3973.50 - 3978.06]  They are coming in from every corner of the earth, not just from South America, but from
[3978.06 - 3980.46]  Africa, Asia, the Middle East.
[3980.46 - 3982.10]  They're coming from everywhere.
[3982.10 - 3984.98]  They're coming at levels that we've never seen before.
[3984.98 - 3987.30]  It is an invasion indeed.
[3987.30 - 3992.82]  And this administration does absolutely nothing to stop them.
[3992.82 - 3994.42]  They're coming from prisons.
[3994.42 - 3995.74]  They're coming from jails.
[3995.74 - 4000.50]  They're coming from mental institutions and insane assailants.
[4000.50 - 4004.62]  I, you know, the press is always on me because I say this.
[4004.62 - 4009.50]  Has anyone seen silence of the lambs?
[4009.50 - 4014.14]  The late great Hannibal Lecter.
[4014.14 - 4017.14]  He'd love to have you for dinner.
[4017.14 - 4021.42]  That's insane assailants.
[4021.42 - 4024.42]  They're emptying out there and insane assailants.
[4024.42 - 4027.70]  And terrorists are coming in at numbers that we've never seen before.
[4027.70 - 4029.94]  Bad things are going to happen.
[4029.94 - 4035.74]  Meanwhile, our crime rate is going up while crime statistics all over the world are going
[4035.74 - 4041.62]  down because they're taking their criminals and they're putting them into our country.
[4041.62 - 4046.58]  A certain country, and I happen to like the president of that country very much, but
[4046.58 - 4052.14]  he's been getting great publicity because he's a wonderful shepherd of the country.
[4052.14 - 4056.18]  He says how well the country is doing because their crime rate is down.
[4056.18 - 4058.58]  And he said he's training all of these rough people.
[4058.58 - 4060.38]  They're rough, rough, rough.
[4060.38 - 4061.38]  He's training them.
[4061.38 - 4062.74]  And I've been reading about this for two years.
[4062.74 - 4063.74]  I think, oh, that's wonderful.
[4063.74 - 4065.98]  Let's take a look at it.
[4065.98 - 4067.82]  But then I realize he's not training them.
[4067.82 - 4073.66]  He's sending all of his criminals, his drug dealers, his people that ring jails.
[4073.66 - 4076.42]  He's sending them all to the United States.
[4076.42 - 4079.06]  And he's different in that he doesn't say that.
[4079.06 - 4082.74]  He's trying to convince everybody what a wonderful job he does in running the country.
[4082.74 - 4084.58]  Well, he doesn't do a wonderful job.
[4084.58 - 4088.06]  And by the way, if I ran one of the countries, many countries, many, many countries from
[4088.06 - 4090.70]  all over, I would be worse than any of them.
[4090.70 - 4099.90]  I would have had the place totally emptied out already.
[4099.90 - 4104.22]  But we become a dumping ground for the rest of the world, which is laughing at us.
[4104.22 - 4106.34]  They think we're stupid.
[4106.34 - 4110.38]  And they can't believe that they're getting away with what they're getting away with,
[4110.38 - 4112.94]  but they're not going to be getting away with it for long.
[4112.94 - 4120.42]  That's what I can tell you.
[4120.42 - 4131.42]  In Venezuela, Caracas, high crime, high crime, Caracas, Venezuela, really a dangerous place.
[4131.42 - 4133.58]  But not anymore.
[4133.58 - 4136.74]  Because in Venezuela, crime is down 72 percent.
[4136.74 - 4141.98]  In fact, if they would ever win this election, I hate to even say that.
[4141.98 - 4147.90]  We will have our next Republican convention in Venezuela because it will be safe.
[4147.90 - 4150.66]  Our cities will be so unsafe.
[4150.66 - 4157.46]  We won't be able to have it there and El Salvador, murders are down by 70 percent.
[4157.46 - 4159.46]  Why are they down?
[4159.46 - 4165.18]  Now he would have you convinced that because he's trained murders to be wonderful people,
[4166.18 - 4172.30]  they're down because they're sending their murderers to the United States of America.
[4172.30 - 4177.14]  This is going to be very bad.
[4177.14 - 4180.14]  And bad things are going to happen and you're seeing it happen all the time.
[4180.14 - 4185.22]  That's why to keep our families safe, the Republican platform promises to launch
[4185.22 - 4192.22]  the largest deportation operation in the history of our country.
[4192.22 - 4198.66]  Even larger than that of President Dwight D. Eisenhower from many years ago.
[4198.66 - 4201.50]  You know, he was a moderate, but he believed very strongly in borders.
[4201.50 - 4205.50]  He had the largest deportation operation we've ever had.
[4205.50 - 4213.66]  Just recently I spoke to the grieving mother of Jocelyn Nungari, a wonderful woman.
[4213.66 - 4220.34]  A precious 12-year-old girl from Houston who last month was tied up assaulted and strangled
[4220.34 - 4226.26]  to death after walking to the convenience store, just a block away from her house.
[4226.26 - 4232.62]  Her body was dumped near the side of the road in a shallow creek found by some onlookers
[4232.62 - 4235.42]  who couldn't believe what they had witnessed.
[4235.42 - 4241.70]  Charged with Jocelyn's heinous murder or two illegal aliens from Venezuela, who came
[4241.70 - 4247.30]  across our border, were in custody and were then released into the country by this horrible,
[4247.30 - 4250.62]  horrible administration that we have right now.
[4250.62 - 4256.38]  I also met recently with the heartbroken mother and sister Rachel Moron.
[4256.38 - 4263.14]  Rachel was a 37-year-old mom of five beautiful children who was brutally raped and murdered
[4263.14 - 4267.10]  while out on her runs, she wanted to keep herself in good shape, but was very important
[4267.10 - 4268.66]  as she was murdered.
[4268.66 - 4274.10]  The monster responsible first killed another woman in El Salvador before he was led into
[4274.10 - 4275.70]  America by the White House.
[4275.70 - 4278.38]  This White House let them in.
[4278.38 - 4283.00]  He then attacked a nine-year-old girl and her mother in a home invasion in Los Angeles
[4283.00 - 4288.30]  before murdering Rachel and Marilyn, traveled all throughout the country, doing tremendous
[4288.30 - 4289.78]  damage.
[4289.78 - 4292.66]  Rachel's mother will never be the same.
[4292.66 - 4293.90]  I spend time with her.
[4293.90 - 4295.70]  She will never be the same.
[4295.70 - 4303.46]  I've also met with the wonderful family of Laken Riley, the brilliant 22-year-old nursing
[4303.46 - 4304.46]  student.
[4304.46 - 4310.80]  She was so proud of being first in her class who was out for a jog on the campus of the
[4310.80 - 4316.58]  University of Georgia when she was assaulted, beaten, and horrifically killed.
[4316.58 - 4322.46]  Yet another American life was stolen by a criminal alien set free by this administration.
[4322.46 - 4325.46]  These were incredible people we're talking about.
[4325.46 - 4328.58]  These were incredible people who died.
[4328.58 - 4331.22]  In the United America, this is my vow.
[4331.22 - 4343.78]  I will not let these killers and criminals into our country.
[4343.78 - 4347.58]  I will keep our sons and daughters safe.
[4347.58 - 4353.82]  As we bring security to our streets, we will help bring stability to the world.
[4353.82 - 4358.94]  I was the first president in modern times to start no new wars.
[4358.94 - 4359.94]  You know, we were the toughest.
[4359.94 - 4361.94]  We were the most respected.
[4361.94 - 4367.66]  And you saw this.
[4367.66 - 4372.22]  Hungry, strong country run by very powerful, tough, leader, tough guy.
[4372.22 - 4374.90]  Press doesn't like him because he's tough.
[4374.90 - 4376.54]  And he came out recently.
[4376.54 - 4380.86]  They were asking him at an interview, the whole world is exploding.
[4380.86 - 4381.86]  What's happening?
[4381.86 - 4382.86]  What's going on?
[4383.26 - 4389.58]  Victor Orban, Prime Minister of Hungary, very tough man.
[4389.58 - 4393.74]  He said, I don't want people coming into my country and blowing up our shopping centers
[4393.74 - 4396.06]  and killing people.
[4396.06 - 4400.86]  But they said to him, tell us what's going wrong, what's happening, what is it?
[4400.86 - 4403.14]  He said, there's only one way you're going to solve it.
[4403.14 - 4409.58]  You got to bring President Trump back to the United States because he kept everybody
[4409.58 - 4410.58]  at bay.
[4410.90 - 4418.66]  He used a word, I wouldn't use because I can't use that word because you'd say it was
[4418.66 - 4419.66]  braggadocious.
[4419.66 - 4421.18]  The press would say he was a braggart.
[4421.18 - 4422.86]  I'm not a braggart.
[4422.86 - 4424.98]  But Victor Orban said it.
[4424.98 - 4427.34]  He said, Russia was afraid of him.
[4427.34 - 4429.82]  China was afraid of him.
[4429.82 - 4431.66]  Everybody was afraid of him.
[4431.66 - 4433.90]  Nothing was going to happen.
[4433.90 - 4436.18]  The whole world was at peace.
[4436.18 - 4440.06]  And now the world is blowing up around us.
[4440.06 - 4444.78]  All of these things that you read about were not going to happen.
[4444.78 - 4449.70]  Under President Bush, Russia invaded Georgia.
[4449.70 - 4454.58]  Under President Obama, Russia took Crimea.
[4454.58 - 4460.54]  Under the current administration, Russia is after all of Ukraine.
[4460.54 - 4464.54]  Under President Trump, Russia took nothing.
[4470.06 - 4486.26]  We defeated 100 percent of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, something that was said to take five
[4486.26 - 4490.30]  years, sir, it'll take five years, sir.
[4490.30 - 4492.58]  We did it in a matter of a couple of months.
[4492.58 - 4493.86]  We have a great military.
[4493.86 - 4494.86]  Our military is not woke.
[4494.86 - 4498.62]  It's just some of the fools on top that are woke.
[4498.62 - 4507.62]  I got along very well.
[4507.62 - 4510.38]  North Korea, Kim Jong-un, I got along very well with him.
[4510.38 - 4511.66]  The press hated when I said that.
[4511.66 - 4513.62]  How could you get along with him well?
[4513.62 - 4518.86]  It's nice to get along with somebody who has a lot of nuclear weapons or otherwise, isn't
[4518.86 - 4519.86]  it?
[4519.86 - 4522.78]  See, in the old days they say, that's a wonderful thing.
[4522.78 - 4526.34]  Now they say, how can you possibly do that?
[4526.34 - 4531.46]  Now I got along with him and we stopped the missile launchers from North Korea now.
[4531.46 - 4536.94]  North Korea is acting up again, but when we get back, I get along with him.
[4536.94 - 4538.58]  He'd like to see me back too.
[4538.58 - 4544.34]  I think he misses me if you want to know the truth.
[4544.34 - 4548.98]  Our opponents inherited a world that peace and turned it into a planet of war.
[4548.98 - 4551.74]  We're in a planet of war.
[4551.74 - 4553.34]  Look at that attack on Israel.
[4553.34 - 4557.22]  Look at what's happening with Ukraine.
[4557.22 - 4559.18]  The cities are just bombed out.
[4559.18 - 4560.50]  How can people live like that?
[4560.50 - 4565.50]  Where buildings, massive buildings are falling to the ground.
[4565.50 - 4570.62]  It began to unravel with the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the worst humiliation
[4570.62 - 4571.94]  in the history of our country.
[4571.94 - 4575.02]  We have never had a humiliation like that.
[4575.02 - 4579.82]  13 heroic U.S. service members were tragically and needlessly killed.
[4579.82 - 4581.90]  45 others were horrifically wounded.
[4581.90 - 4584.14]  Nobody ever talks about them.
[4584.14 - 4591.46]  No arms, no legs, face explosions, horrifically wounded.
[4591.46 - 4598.78]  And by the way, we have a man in this room who's running for the U.S.
[4598.78 - 4609.62]  Center from a great state, Nevada, named Sam Brown, who paid the ultimate price.
[4609.62 - 4611.70]  Thank you, Sam.
[4611.70 - 4615.30]  Thank you, Sam.
[4615.30 - 4620.22]  Thank you.
[4620.22 - 4626.58]  He paid the biggest price, probably ever paid by anybody that is running for office, and
[4626.58 - 4628.94]  I think he's going to do great.
[4628.94 - 4635.22]  He's running against a person that is not good, not respected, a total lightweight.
[4635.22 - 4636.58]  But Sam, I think paid really.
[4636.58 - 4643.00]  We were talking about it with some of the senators that are working so hard for Sam, but
[4643.00 - 4647.54]  he paid the biggest price of any senator ever to run for the Senate.
[4647.54 - 4649.86]  I don't think anybody's ever what he did.
[4649.86 - 4653.42]  He was a real hero, a really great person, and he's running.
[4653.42 - 4657.94]  And I hope that everybody gets out and votes for Sam Brown.
[4657.94 - 4670.86]  And we also left behind $85 billion worth of military equipment, along with many American
[4670.86 - 4674.34]  citizens who left behind.
[4674.34 - 4679.78]  Many, many American citizens, emboldened by that disaster Russia invaded Ukraine.
[4679.78 - 4682.46]  They saw this group of people that were incompetent.
[4682.46 - 4683.82]  We took the soldiers out first.
[4683.82 - 4686.50]  No, no, we're going to take the soldiers out second.
[4686.50 - 4687.78]  They would have followed my plan.
[4687.78 - 4689.50]  We had a great plan.
[4689.50 - 4693.90]  But the plan only kicked in if they did everything perfectly, and they weren't doing things perfectly,
[4693.90 - 4695.90]  so we said it doesn't kick in.
[4695.90 - 4701.28]  You know, 18 months in Afghanistan, we didn't have one, so they were killing them left and
[4701.28 - 4703.98]  right snipers.
[4703.98 - 4707.82]  And I spoke to the head of the Taliban.
[4707.82 - 4709.46]  You've heard this story.
[4709.46 - 4713.06]  Abdul, still there, still the head of the Taliban.
[4713.06 - 4714.06]  The press got on me.
[4714.06 - 4715.06]  Why would you speak to him?
[4715.06 - 4717.30]  He said, because that's where the killing is.
[4717.30 - 4720.54]  I don't have to speak to somebody that has nothing to do with it.
[4720.54 - 4722.82]  And I told him, don't ever do that.
[4722.82 - 4724.02]  Don't ever do that again.
[4724.02 - 4725.58]  Don't ever, ever do that again.
[4725.58 - 4727.10]  You're going to stop.
[4727.10 - 4732.74]  Because during the Obama administration, many great people and soldiers, a lot of soldiers
[4732.74 - 4734.46]  were being killed from a long distance.
[4734.46 - 4738.78]  And I said, if you keep doing that, you're going to be hit harder than anybody's ever been
[4738.78 - 4740.18]  hit by a country before.
[4740.18 - 4750.50]  And he said, I understand your excellency.
[4750.50 - 4753.42]  Call me your excellency.
[4753.42 - 4755.42]  I wonder if he calls the other guy your excellency.
[4755.42 - 4756.42]  I doubt him.
[4756.42 - 4758.26]  The other guy gave him everything.
[4758.26 - 4759.82]  I mean, what kind of a deal was that?
[4759.82 - 4762.26]  He walked out, gave him everything.
[4762.26 - 4767.66]  You know that right now, Afghanistan is one of the largest sellers of weapons in the
[4767.66 - 4774.26]  world, the selling the brand new beautiful weapons that we gave them.
[4774.26 - 4780.14]  But think of it, he actually said to me, but why but why do you show me a picture of my
[4780.14 - 4781.14]  home?
[4781.14 - 4788.10]  I said, you'll have to ask your people, or one of your wives.
[4788.10 - 4789.38]  But he could figure it out.
[4789.38 - 4797.22]  And for 18 months, we had not one attack on an American soldier by the Taliban.
[4797.22 - 4806.66]  18 months.
[4806.66 - 4809.30]  And then we had that horrible day where soldiers were killed.
[4809.30 - 4813.38]  I was not there because of a ridiculous election.
[4813.38 - 4815.98]  But we had that horrible attack.
[4815.98 - 4820.78]  And they also gave a bug, or one of the biggest bases anywhere in the world air bases, anywhere
[4820.78 - 4826.14]  in the world, the longest runways, most powerful hardened thickened runways.
[4826.14 - 4830.94]  And I liked it, not because of Afghanistan, I liked it because of China.
[4830.94 - 4835.06]  It's one hour away from where China makes their nuclear weapons.
[4835.06 - 4837.34]  And you know who has it now?
[4837.34 - 4839.30]  China has it now.
[4839.30 - 4843.42]  We were keeping that.
[4843.42 - 4849.10]  And now China is likewise circling Taiwan and Russian warships and nuclear submarines are
[4849.10 - 4852.90]  operating 60 miles off the coast in Cuba.
[4852.90 - 4853.90]  Do you know that?
[4853.90 - 4856.02]  The press refuses to write about it.
[4856.02 - 4858.06]  That were me running this country.
[4858.06 - 4861.82]  And we had nuclear submarines in Cuba.
[4861.82 - 4866.22]  I will tell you that headlines every day would be what's wrong with our president.
[4866.22 - 4867.22]  You don't even hear this.
[4867.22 - 4868.74]  You're not hearing about this.
[4868.74 - 4877.42]  Russia has nuclear submarines and warships 60 miles away, Mr. Congressman, from Miami,
[4877.42 - 4879.42]  by the way, happens to be here.
[4879.42 - 4880.42]  Correct?
[4881.42 - 4883.62]  In Cuba.
[4883.62 - 4886.14]  And that would not be stood for if or somebody else.
[4886.14 - 4890.58]  They don't even meant, they don't want to mention it, but now maybe they will.
[4890.58 - 4896.62]  And the entire world, I tell you this, we want our hostages back.
[4896.62 - 4900.14]  And they better be back before I assume office.
[4900.14 - 4902.14]  Well, you will be paying a very big price.
[4910.42 - 4926.66]  With our victory in November, the years of war, weakness, and chaos will be over.
[4926.66 - 4928.70]  I don't have wars.
[4928.70 - 4932.66]  I had no wars other than ISIS, which I defeated, but that was a war that was started.
[4932.66 - 4933.74]  We had no wars.
[4933.74 - 4937.22]  I could stop wars with a telephone call.
[4937.22 - 4941.70]  I could stop wars with just a telephone call.
[4941.70 - 4945.58]  If properly stated, it would never start.
[4945.58 - 4951.06]  We will replenish our military and build an iron dome missile defense system to ensure
[4951.06 - 4954.34]  that no enemy can strike our homeland.
[4954.34 - 4959.78]  And this great iron dome will be built entirely in the USA.
[4959.78 - 4961.78]  We're going to build it.
[4961.78 - 4963.30]  The USA.
[4963.30 - 4966.66]  And Wisconsin.
[4966.66 - 4972.66]  Wisconsin, just like I gave you that massive ship contract, and you're doing a very nice
[4972.66 - 4976.46]  job, Governor, right?
[4976.46 - 4977.62]  Thank you, Governor.
[4977.62 - 4978.78]  And they're doing a great job.
[4978.78 - 4982.14]  In fact, I had a little design change and we gave them a tremendous force.
[4982.14 - 4984.78]  Essentially, what we used to call destroyers.
[4984.78 - 4987.14]  These are now the most beautiful.
[4987.14 - 4990.74]  They look like, yes, they said, we have to take the bow and we have to make it a little
[4990.74 - 4994.98]  nicer and a little point at the top instead of a flat nose.
[4994.98 - 4998.18]  And the people at the shipyard said, this guy sort of knows what he's doing.
[4998.18 - 5000.70]  We have most beautiful ships, right, Governor?
[5000.70 - 5002.74]  Everybody's sitting over there.
[5002.74 - 5004.90]  And it was a big contract that everybody wanted.
[5004.90 - 5006.38]  I gave it to Wisconsin.
[5006.38 - 5012.14]  But we're going to have a lot of that built right here in the state of Wisconsin and all
[5012.14 - 5013.54]  other states.
[5013.54 - 5015.06]  Israel has an iron dome.
[5015.06 - 5017.54]  They have a missile defense system.
[5017.54 - 5021.18]  342 missiles were shot into Israel.
[5021.18 - 5022.70]  And only one got through a little bit.
[5022.70 - 5023.70]  It was badly wounded.
[5023.70 - 5024.70]  It fell to the ground.
[5024.70 - 5025.98]  But most of them are.
[5025.98 - 5030.10]  And Ronald Reagan wanted this many years ago, but we really didn't have the technology many
[5030.10 - 5031.10]  years ago.
[5031.10 - 5035.94]  Remember they called it starship, spaceship, anything to mock him.
[5035.94 - 5042.50]  But he was a very good president, very, very good.
[5042.50 - 5045.62]  But now we have unbelievable technology.
[5045.62 - 5047.78]  And why should other countries have this?
[5047.78 - 5048.78]  And we don't.
[5048.78 - 5050.98]  No, no, we're going to build an iron dome over our country.
[5050.98 - 5056.10]  We're going to be sure that nothing can come and harm our people.
[5056.10 - 5060.50]  And again, from an economic development standpoint, we're going to make it all right here.
[5060.50 - 5063.54]  No more sending it out to other countries in order to help.
[5063.54 - 5065.34]  It's America first.
[5065.34 - 5067.66]  America for it.
[5067.66 - 5071.22]  We will unleash the power of American innovation.
[5071.22 - 5076.74]  And as we do, we will soon be on the verge of finding the cures to cancer, Alzheimer's
[5076.74 - 5079.50]  disease, and many other diseases.
[5079.50 - 5083.58]  We're going to get to the bottom of it.
[5083.58 - 5087.94]  You remember this gentleman that I don't want to mention other than one time I had to,
[5087.94 - 5090.90]  because when you say you're the 10 worst, I had to do it.
[5090.90 - 5094.38]  I didn't want anybody to be confused.
[5094.38 - 5096.82]  But this man said, we're going to find the cure to cancer.
[5096.82 - 5097.82]  Nothing happened.
[5097.82 - 5102.30]  We're going to get to the cure for cancer and Alzheimer's and so many other things were
[5102.30 - 5105.78]  so close to doing something great.
[5105.78 - 5109.70]  We need a leader that will let it be done.
[5109.70 - 5116.10]  We will not have men playing in women's sports that will end immediately.
[5116.10 - 5130.82]  And we will restore and renovate our nations once great cities, making them safe, clean,
[5130.82 - 5132.30]  and beautiful again.
[5132.30 - 5137.86]  And that includes our nation's capital, which is a horrible killing field.
[5137.86 - 5139.82]  So many things they leave from Wisconsin.
[5139.82 - 5141.66]  They go to look at the Washington Monument.
[5141.66 - 5144.86]  They end up getting stabbed, killed or shot.
[5144.86 - 5156.70]  We will be very soon, very proud of our capital, again, Washington, D.C.
[5156.70 - 5163.82]  America is on the cusp of a new golden age, but we will have the courage to seize it.
[5163.82 - 5164.86]  We're going to take it.
[5164.86 - 5169.42]  We're going to make it a current, I mean, and we're going to bring this into a golden age
[5169.42 - 5171.10]  like never seen before.
[5171.10 - 5173.98]  Remember this, China wants to do it, Japan wants to do it.
[5173.98 - 5176.02]  All of these countries want to do it.
[5176.02 - 5183.06]  We have to produce massive amounts of energy if we're going to produce the new, if you look
[5183.06 - 5188.86]  at some of the things that have been done and some of the things that we're going to do.
[5188.86 - 5197.66]  But AI needs tremendous, literally twice the electricity that's available now in our country.
[5197.66 - 5199.30]  Can you imagine?
[5199.30 - 5204.50]  But instead we're spending places where they recharge electric cars.
[5204.50 - 5209.50]  They built eight charges at a certain location toward the Midwest.
[5209.50 - 5212.78]  Eight charges for $9 billion.
[5212.78 - 5217.54]  Think of them as a tank for filling up your gas.
[5217.54 - 5218.54]  Think of it.
[5218.54 - 5226.82]  They spent $9 billion on eight charges, three of which didn't work.
[5226.82 - 5231.90]  And if you are going to do this all over our country, this crazy electric mandate, if
[5231.90 - 5237.14]  you're going to do this, and by the way, I'm all for electric, they have their application.
[5237.14 - 5243.46]  And if somebody wants to buy a gas, powered car, gasoline, powered car, or a hybrid, they're
[5243.46 - 5245.10]  going to be able to do it.
[5245.10 - 5257.70]  And we're going to make that change on day one.
[5257.70 - 5265.70]  So to conclude, just a few short days ago, my journey with you nearly ended.
[5265.70 - 5267.06]  We know that.
[5267.06 - 5273.30]  And yet, here we are tonight all gathered together, talking about the future promise and a
[5273.30 - 5277.34]  total renewal of a thing we love very much.
[5277.34 - 5279.54]  It's called America.
[5279.54 - 5281.62]  We live in a world of miracles.
[5281.62 - 5287.10]  None of us knows God's plan or where life's adventure will take us.
[5287.10 - 5293.82]  I want to thank Franklin Graham for being here tonight as an outstanding man.
[5294.82 - 5297.14]  He wrote me a note recently.
[5297.14 - 5298.94]  I have a lot of respect for him.
[5298.94 - 5301.50]  Sir, I love your storytelling.
[5301.50 - 5303.62]  I think it's great in front of these big rallies.
[5303.62 - 5305.82]  But sir, please do me one favor.
[5305.82 - 5307.70]  It won't make any difference.
[5307.70 - 5312.74]  Please don't use any foul language.
[5312.74 - 5315.74]  I was a little embarrassed.
[5315.74 - 5317.14]  He said it won't make any difference.
[5317.14 - 5321.46]  Actually, it's not quite as good, but I've been very good.
[5321.46 - 5324.10]  The story is not quite as good to be honest.
[5324.10 - 5326.02]  I've got to have a little talk with Franklin.
[5326.02 - 5327.02]  But he was great.
[5327.02 - 5328.58]  He's a great gentleman.
[5328.58 - 5330.10]  His father was so incredible.
[5330.10 - 5331.62]  Billy Graham.
[5331.62 - 5335.66]  My father used to love taking me to see Billy Graham.
[5335.66 - 5339.62]  My father would take me to see Billy Graham at Yankee Stadium.
[5339.62 - 5341.46]  He had the biggest rally scene.
[5341.46 - 5344.46]  He was a good rally guy too.
[5344.46 - 5347.18]  But he'd get up and he was a fantastic guy.
[5347.18 - 5350.30]  My father loved Billy Graham.
[5350.30 - 5351.58]  But I love Franklin Graham.
[5351.58 - 5353.34]  I think Franklin's been fantastic.
[5353.34 - 5353.94]  And I'm trying.
[5353.94 - 5357.70]  I'm working so hard to adhere to his note to me.
[5357.70 - 5360.74]  I'm working hard on it, Franklin.
[5360.74 - 5364.18]  But if the events of last Saturday make anything clear,
[5364.18 - 5367.70]  it is that every single moment we have on Earth
[5367.70 - 5369.14]  is a gift from God.
[5369.14 - 5378.22]  We have to make the most of every day for the people
[5378.22 - 5380.94]  and for the country that we love.
[5380.94 - 5384.46]  The attacker in Pennsylvania wanted to stop our movement.
[5384.46 - 5388.66]  But the truth is, the movement has never been about me.
[5388.66 - 5390.02]  It has always been about you.
[5390.02 - 5390.82]  It's your movement.
[5390.82 - 5392.90]  It's the biggest movement in the history of our country
[5392.90 - 5394.14]  by far.
[5394.14 - 5397.30]  Can't be stopped.
[5397.30 - 5399.06]  It can't be stopped.
[5399.06 - 5402.98]  It has always been about the hardworking patriotic citizens
[5402.98 - 5404.90]  of America.
[5404.90 - 5407.70]  For too long, our nation has settled for too little.
[5407.70 - 5410.18]  We've settled for too little.
[5410.18 - 5413.82]  We've given everything to other nations, to other people.
[5413.82 - 5416.22]  You've been told to lower your expectations
[5416.22 - 5418.62]  and to accept less for your families.
[5418.62 - 5422.26]  I am here tonight with the opposite message.
[5422.26 - 5424.98]  Your expectations are not big enough.
[5424.98 - 5425.98]  They're not big enough.
[5425.98 - 5433.86]  It is time to start expecting and demanding the best
[5433.86 - 5437.54]  leadership in the world, leadership that is bold, dynamic,
[5437.54 - 5439.26]  relentless, and fearless.
[5439.26 - 5440.94]  We can do that.
[5440.94 - 5442.02]  We are Americans.
[5442.02 - 5443.90]  Ambition is our heritage.
[5443.90 - 5446.54]  Greatness is our birthright.
[5446.54 - 5449.98]  But as long as our energies are spent fighting each other,
[5449.98 - 5453.78]  our destiny will remain out of reach.
[5453.78 - 5455.86]  And that's not acceptable.
[5455.90 - 5459.42]  We must instead take that energy and use it to realize
[5459.42 - 5463.78]  our country's true potential and write our own thrilling
[5463.78 - 5466.18]  chapter of the American story.
[5466.18 - 5467.30]  We can do it together.
[5467.30 - 5468.18]  We will unite.
[5468.18 - 5469.94]  We are going to come together.
[5469.94 - 5472.62]  And success will bring us together.
[5472.62 - 5485.46]  It is a story of love, sacrifice, and so many other things
[5485.46 - 5488.58]  and remember the word devotion.
[5488.58 - 5491.38]  It's unmatched devotion.
[5491.38 - 5495.34]  Our American ancestors, cross the Delaware, survived the icy
[5495.34 - 5499.18]  winter at Valley Forge and defeated a mighty empire to
[5499.18 - 5502.22]  establish our cherished republic.
[5502.22 - 5503.22]  They fought so hard.
[5503.22 - 5505.02]  They lost so many.
[5505.02 - 5508.26]  They pushed thousands and thousands of miles across a
[5508.26 - 5512.14]  dangerous frontier, taming the wilderness to build a life
[5512.14 - 5515.30]  and a magnificent home for their family.
[5515.30 - 5517.82]  They packed their families into covered wagons,
[5517.82 - 5524.38]  trekked across hazardous trails, scaled towering mountains,
[5524.38 - 5528.14]  and braved rivers and rapids to stake their claim on the
[5528.14 - 5533.18]  wide open, new, and very beautiful frontier.
[5533.18 - 5536.30]  When our way of life was threatened American patriots marched
[5536.30 - 5540.54]  onto the battlefield, raced into enemy strongholds and
[5540.54 - 5545.34]  stared down death and stared down those enemies to keep
[5545.34 - 5547.78]  alive the flame of freedom.
[5547.78 - 5551.74]  At Yorktown, Gettysburg, and Midway, they joined the
[5551.74 - 5553.66]  roll call of immortal heroes.
[5553.66 - 5556.02]  So many horror, just so many heroes.
[5556.02 - 5558.30]  So many great, great people.
[5558.30 - 5560.02]  And we have to cherish those people.
[5560.02 - 5561.46]  We can't forget those people.
[5561.46 - 5563.18]  We have to cherish those people.
[5563.18 - 5571.62]  And building monuments to those great people is a good
[5571.62 - 5574.86]  thing, not a bad thing.
[5574.86 - 5578.30]  They saved our country.
[5578.30 - 5580.82]  No challenge was too much.
[5580.82 - 5583.98]  No hardship was too great.
[5583.98 - 5586.26]  No enemy was too fierce.
[5586.26 - 5590.58]  Together these patriots sold it on and endured, and they
[5590.58 - 5594.50]  prevailed, because they had faith in each other, faith in
[5594.50 - 5597.58]  their country, and above all they had faith in their God.
[5597.58 - 5607.54]  Just like our ancestors, we must now come together, rise
[5607.54 - 5610.42]  above past differences.
[5610.42 - 5614.42]  Any disagreements have to be put aside and go forward united
[5614.42 - 5619.42]  as one people, one nation pledging allegiance to one great,
[5619.42 - 5622.82]  beautiful, I think it's so beautiful, American flag.
[5622.82 - 5631.46]  Tonight I ask for your partnership, for your support, and I
[5631.46 - 5634.94]  am humbly asking for your vote.
[5634.94 - 5638.02]  Want your vote?
[5638.02 - 5641.38]  Can I make our country great again?
[5641.38 - 5644.94]  Every day I will strive to honor the trust you have placed in
[5644.94 - 5648.22]  me, and I will never, ever let you down.
[5648.22 - 5652.42]  And I promise that I will never let you down.
[5652.42 - 5657.06]  To all of the forgotten men and women who have been neglected, abandoned, and
[5657.06 - 5661.70]  left behind, you will be forgotten no longer.
[5661.70 - 5666.50]  We will press forward and together we will win, win, win.
[5678.22 - 5688.86]  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win.
[5688.86 - 5694.66]  Nothing will sway us, nothing will slow us, and no one will ever
[5694.66 - 5699.26]  stop us.
[5699.26 - 5702.78]  No matter what dangers come our way, no matter what obstacles lie
[5702.78 - 5707.42]  in our path, we will keep striving toward our shared and glorious
[5707.42 - 5710.82]  destiny, and we will not fail.
[5710.82 - 5713.82]  We will not fail.
[5713.82 - 5720.30]  Together we will save this country, we will restore the
[5720.30 - 5724.66]  republic, and we will usher in the rich and wonderful
[5724.66 - 5728.90]  tomorrows that our people so truly deserve.
[5728.90 - 5733.70]  America's future will be bigger, better, bolder, brighter,
[5733.70 - 5737.38]  happier, stronger, freer, greater, and more
[5737.38 - 5744.38]  united than ever before.
[5744.38 - 5761.54]  And quite simply put, we will very quickly make America great again.
[5761.54 - 5763.54]  Thank you very much.
[5763.54 - 5764.54]  Thank you very much.
[5764.54 - 5767.94]  God bless you.
[5767.94 - 5771.54]  God bless you, Wisconsin, and God bless the United States of
[5771.54 - 5772.94]  America, our great country.
[5772.94 - 5774.74]  Thank you very much, everybody.
[5774.74 - 5775.74]  Thank you.
[5806.74 - 5810.74]  Oh, God, I'm coming.
[5810.74 - 5812.74]  I'm going to throw it away.
[5812.74 - 5814.74]  I think it's safer.
[5814.74 - 5819.74]  We don't need to reach out the bell.
[5819.74 - 5823.74]  We'll think of, and go down.
[5823.74 - 5827.74]  In a river of trouble, about to drown.
[5827.74 - 5832.74]  Oh, God, I'm coming.
[5833.74 - 5836.74]  Oh, God, I'm coming.
[5836.74 - 5840.74]  Oh, God, I'm coming.
[5840.74 - 5845.74]  Oh, God, I'm coming.
[5845.74 - 5849.74]  Oh, God, I'm coming.
[5849.74 - 5853.74]  When you get closer, be your cover.
[5853.74 - 5856.74]  When you know I'm here.
[5857.74 - 5862.74]  No need to suffer, because I'm here.
[5862.74 - 5866.74]  Oh, God, I'm coming.
[5866.74 - 5870.74]  Oh, God, I'm coming.
[5870.74 - 5875.74]  Oh, God, I'm coming.
[5875.74 - 5881.74]  Oh, God, I'm coming.
[5881.74 - 5893.74]  Is there something to tell you about?
[5893.74 - 5896.70]  No need to suffer.
[5896.70 - 5905.68]  No need to suffer.
[5905.68 - 5909.84]  Oh, God, I'm coming.
[6209.84 - 6219.38]  That heavy rainarlos!!
[6279.38 - 6281.38]  Oh, my God.
[6281.38 - 6283.38]  Oh, my God.
[6283.38 - 6285.38]  Oh, my God.
[6285.38 - 6287.38]  Oh, my God.
[6315.38 - 6317.38]  Oh, my God.
[6317.38 - 6319.38]  Oh, my God.
[6319.38 - 6321.38]  Oh, my God.
[6321.38 - 6323.38]  Oh, my God.
[6323.38 - 6327.38]  Oh, my god, who you.
[6327.38 - 6329.38]  You're trapped.
[6329.38 - 6333.38]  You can't let your neighbor back.
[6333.38 - 6335.38]  Let alone used to be in my hope,
[6335.38 - 6341.38]  It can melt in the steam.
[6341.38 - 6346.38]  I'm not a man, I'm not a man
[6346.38 - 6351.38]  And I miss this guy's pin and I miss the phone free away
[6351.38 - 6356.38]  From a toast to California to a show of the family
[6356.38 - 6361.38]  You can set you alive, you've got back into USA
[6372.38 - 6381.38]  Look at how I pull down and search for a corner to head
[6381.38 - 6387.38]  That's my purpose as a woman over here the nine days
[6387.38 - 6392.38]  Get your boxes, you're nothing like it does in the USA

[6535.38 - 6538.38]  Sweet sweet cannon was digging our ass
[6539.38 - 6543.38]  She's all the whole show and that's a natural fact
[6543.38 - 6547.38]  But my own life, I'm afraid it can't
[6547.38 - 6550.38]  I got to tell you a focus is the thing

[6596.38 - 6599.38]  These five ladies had a prayer
[6599.38 - 6601.38]  They was out for a beer
